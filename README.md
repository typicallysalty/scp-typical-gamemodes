Plugin that adds a Murder Mystery gamemode to SCP: SL!
This is a rip-off of a plugin I'm currently making, SCP: Secret Funhouse --- More details about this project will be released later

How the gamemode works:
There are 2 sides - The SCP Foundation and the CI Inturder.
The CI Intruder has to kill all SCP Foundation Personel under 15 minutes, while keeping his identity secret.
The SCP Foundation has to find the CI Intruder and kill him.

Classes:
CI Intruder - Chaos Insurgency
Has a Silenced MP7 and an USP. His USP does nothing, however.

The Scout - SCP Foundation
Has SCP-268 and an USP.

The Bystander - SCP Foundation
Has an USP.

The USP for the CI Intruder does nothing, however, the one for the SCP Foundation -
Kills immediately who was shot.
If the target was the CI intruder, congratulations, you win!
Otherwise, the target will be saved and the attacker will die.
